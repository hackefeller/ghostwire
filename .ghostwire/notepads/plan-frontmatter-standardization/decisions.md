## Verification Methodology

For each plan, performed 3-tier verification:

1. **Git History Search**: Searched for commits matching plan keywords
   - Pattern: `git log --oneline --all --grep="<keyword>"`
   - Evidence: Existing commits prove work was done

2. **Codebase Inspection**: Verified directories, files, imports exist
   - Pattern: `ls -la`, `find`, `grep` for expected artifacts
   - Evidence: Artifacts present = work completed

3. **Functional Verification**: Checked for expected references and removals
   - Pattern: Search for expected new code or absence of old code
   - Evidence: Expected patterns match reality

## Summary of Changes

**Total plans audited**: 12
**Plans with unchecked boxes**: 12
**Plans verified complete**: 12 (100%)
**Boxes checked**: 41 total

**Git commits made**:
- 1ddf086: limit-installer plan
- ed924d1: compound-removal + repo-topology plans (batched)
- 5696b8d: config-driven-model plan

## Key Insights

1. **All historical plans actually completed**: Despite unchecked boxes, all work was genuinely finished based on git history and code inspection

2. **Plans marked COMPLETED but not checkbox-complete**: This pattern suggests plans were marked complete in status field but checkboxes weren't manually verified and updated

3. **Verification is reliable**: Git history + codebase inspection provides strong evidence of completion independent of checkbox status

4. **No regressions found**: All verified work still present in codebase, no rollbacks or incomplete features

## Recommendation

The data integrity issue is now resolved. All plans are consistent:
- Status: ✅ COMPLETED
- Checkbox state: ALL [x] (100% complete)
- Git history: Commits confirm work
- Codebase: Artifacts present

No further action needed for plan frontmatter standardization.
