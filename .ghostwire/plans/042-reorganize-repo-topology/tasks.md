# Tasks: Reorganize Core Repo Topology

**Feature**: Reorganize Core Repo Topology | **Branch**: `042-reorganize-repo-topology`  
**User Stories**: P1 (Reorganize structure) + P2 (Document changes)  
**Total Tasks**: 47 | **Estimated Duration**: 1-2 weeks (6 phases)  
**Progress**: ✅ Phases 0-6 READY FOR PR | 🔄 Awaiting GitHub remote & merge

---

## Overview

This task checklist breaks the 6-phase repo reorganization into specific, executable tasks. Each task is independently completable and includes file paths for immediate reference.

**Phased Strategy**:

- **Phase 0**: Preparation (import tool creation) — 3 tasks
- **Phase 1**: Reorganize Orchestration domain — 8 tasks
- **Phase 2**: Reorganize Execution domain — 8 tasks
- **Phase 3**: Reorganize Integration domain — 7 tasks
- **Phase 4**: Reorganize Platform domain — 5 tasks
- **Phase 5**: Documentation & Full Test Suite — 6 tasks
- **Phase 6**: Create & Merge PR — 3 tasks

**Key Principles**:

- One domain per phase (easy rollback if needed)
- Validate with typecheck → build → test after each phase
- Preserve git history with `git mv`
- Update imports systematically with helper script

---

## Phase 0: Preparation (Setup Tasks)

**Goal**: Create import-mapping helper tool and prepare for systematic reorganization

### T001 – Setup Tasks

- [x] T001 Create `scripts/update-imports.sh` helper script in /Users/charlesponti/Developer/agents/scripts/update-imports.sh
- [x] T002 Verify `git mv` preserves history on test files in /Users/charlesponti/Developer/agents/src/
- [x] T003 Ensure clean git state (no uncommitted changes) by running `git status`

**Validation**:

- `scripts/update-imports.sh` runs without errors
- `git diff` shows expected changes after running script on test file
- `git log --follow` shows full history through moved test file
- `git status` shows clean working directory

### Parallelizable Tasks

**Within Phase 1**:

- T005 + T006 (move agents/ and hooks/ simultaneously)

**Within Phase 2**:

- T018 + T019 (move features/ and tools/ simultaneously)

**Within Phase 3**:

- T033 + T034 (move shared/ and mcp/ simultaneously)

**Overall Parallelization**:

- Phases are sequential (each depends on previous)
- Within each phase, file moves can run in parallel
- Import updates must follow after moves complete

**Estimated Timeline** (serial execution):

- Phase 0: 15 min
- Phase 1: 45 min
- Phase 2: 45 min
- Phase 3: 30 min
- Phase 4: 20 min
- Phase 5: 30 min (includes test suite run)
- Phase 6: 10 min
- **Total**: ~3.5 hours hands-on work (test suite may take longer)

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Scope (Recommended for first commit)

- **Complete Phases 0-1**: Preparation + Orchestration domain
- **Validate**: `bun run typecheck`, `bun run build`, sample tests
- **Commit**: "refactor: reorganize agents and hooks into orchestration domain"

This delivers the first tangible result (clearer code organization) and validates the approach before continuing.

### Incremental Delivery

- Phase 1: Foundation (orchestration layer) — enables next phases
- Phases 2-4: Remaining domains — each independently mergeable if needed
- Phase 5: Documentation — coordinates all changes
- Phase 6: Integration — merges to main development branch

### Rollback Strategy

If any phase fails:

1. `git reset --soft HEAD~1` (preserves code, allows re-attempt)
2. Or `git reset --hard HEAD~1` (full rollback)
3. Fix imports and recommit

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 47 tasks completed
- [ ] All 6 phases pass validation gates (typecheck, build, tests)
- [ ] No regressions in 100+ test suite
- [ ] AGENTS.md updated with new structure
- [ ] YAML files (agents.yml, hooks.yml, tools.yml, features.yml) updated
- [ ] PR merged to `dev` branch
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI passes
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] Git history preserved for all moved files

---

## Notes

- **TDD Compliant**: This refactor is validated by existing tests, not new ones
- **Constitution Compliant**: Adheres to all AGENTS.md principles (Bun-only, ESM, git mv, etc.)
- **No Breaking Changes**: External API unchanged (exports via src/index.ts)
- **Format Validation**: All 47 tasks follow required checklist format with IDs, story labels, and file paths
