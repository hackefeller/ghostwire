# Tasks: Plugin to Builtin Migration

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/044-plugin-to-builtin-migration/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), data-model.md, research.md  
**Branch**: `044-plugin-to-builtin-migration`

**Organization**: This is a pure migration task with no separate user stories. Tasks are organized into logical phases: Setup, Commands, Skills, Registration, and Cleanup.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Not applicable (migration task, not feature development)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

**Checkpoint**: Migration complete, all tests passing, no build errors

---

## Phase 8: Final Validation

**Purpose**: Comprehensive validation across all migrated components

- [ ] T065 Verify skills load correctly by checking skill registry has 14+ new skills
- [ ] T066 Run quickstart.md validation steps: follow the guide in `specs/044-plugin-to-builtin-migration/quickstart.md`
- [ ] T067 Create final commit: `git add . && git commit -m "044: Migrate 21 commands and 14 skills to builtin directories"`

**Checkpoint**: All components working, migration validated, ready for PR

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Commands (Phases 2-3)**: Depends on Setup completion
- **Command Registration (Phase 4)**: Depends on Commands (Phases 2-3) completion
- **Skills (Phase 5)**: Can start immediately after Setup, independent of Commands
- **Skill Registration (Phase 6)**: Depends on Skills (Phase 5) completion
- **Cleanup (Phase 7)**: Depends on Command Registration (Phase 4) AND Skill Registration (Phase 6)
- **Validation (Phase 8)**: Depends on Cleanup (Phase 7) completion

### Critical Path

```
Setup (T001-T004)
    ↓
    ├→ Commands (T005-T025) ──→ Workflow Commands (T026-T030) ──→ Registration (T031-T035)
    │                                                                    ↓
    │                                                               Cleanup (T056-T063)
    │                                                                    ↓
    └→ Skills (T036-T050) ──────────────────────────────────────→ Registration (T051-T055)
                                                                        ↓
                                                                   Validation (T064-T067)
```

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Phase 2-3 (Commands)**:

- All command migrations marked [P] can run in parallel
- Suggested: 5 developers × 5 commands each = 3 rounds of 5 tasks
- Example: Developer 1 does T005-T009, Developer 2 does T010-T014, etc.

**Within Phase 5 (Skills)**:

- All skill migrations marked [P] can run in parallel
- Suggested: 4 developers × 3 skills each = 1 round (some developers get 4)
- Example: Developer 1 does T036-T039, Developer 2 does T040-T043, etc.

**Command vs Skills**:

- After Setup complete: Commands and Skills migration can run in parallel
- Different developers can work on commands while others work on skills
- Phases 2-5 can overlap (Setup → Commands Phase 4 while Skills Phase 5 ongoing)

---

## Parallel Example: Batch Migration (Recommended Approach)

```bash
# Setup phase (sequential, single developer)
Task: T001 Verify branch
Task: T002 Run baseline tests
Task: T003 Run typecheck
Task: T004 Create directories

# Command migration (can parallelize 5 at a time)
Parallel run 1:
  Task: T005 (plan_review)
  Task: T006 (changelog)
  Task: T007 (create-agent-skill)
  Task: T008 (deepen-plan)
  Task: T009 (deploy-docs)

Parallel run 2:
  Task: T010 (feature-video)
  Task: T011 (generate-command)
  Task: T012 (heal-skill)
  Task: T013 (lfg)
  Task: T014 (quiz-me)

# ...continue with T015-T025, then T026-T030

# Skill migration (can parallelize 4 at a time while commands register)
Parallel run (while T031-T035 registering):
  Task: T036 (andrew-kane-gem-writer)
  Task: T037 (brainstorming)
  Task: T038 (coding-tutor)
  Task: T039 (compound-docs)

# After command registration passes, skill registration
Task: T051-T055 Register skills
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Sequential (Single Developer, ~6 hours)

1. Complete Setup (T001-T004): ~15 min
2. Complete Commands (T005-T030): ~3 hours (migrate 26 files)
3. Register Commands (T031-T035): ~30 min
4. Complete Skills (T036-T050): ~1.5 hours (move 14 directories)
5. Register Skills (T051-T055): ~20 min
6. Cleanup & Validation (T056-T067): ~20 min

### Parallel (Multiple Developers, ~2.5 hours with 4 developers)

1. Developer A: Setup (T001-T004) while others wait - 15 min
2. Developers A-D (parallel):
   - Dev A: Command Batch 1 (T005-T009)
   - Dev B: Command Batch 2 (T010-T014)
   - Dev C: Command Batch 3 (T015-T019)
   - Dev D: Skill Batch 1 (T036-T039)
   - Time: ~45 min

3. Developers A-D (parallel):
   - Dev A: Command Batch 4 (T020-T024)
   - Dev B: Workflow Commands (T026-T030)
   - Dev C: Skill Batch 2 (T040-T043)
   - Dev D: Skill Batch 3 (T044-T047)
   - Time: ~45 min

4. Developers A-C (parallel):
   - Dev A: Skill Batch 4 (T048-T050)
   - Dev B & C: Idle/review
   - Time: ~15 min

5. Command Registration (sequential bottleneck): ~30 min (T031-T035)
6. Skill Registration (parallel with testing): ~20 min (T051-T055)
7. Cleanup & Validation (parallel): ~20 min (T056-T067)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies → parallelizable
- Each migration task is self-contained: read source, write target, follow data-model.md mapping
- Tests must pass after each phase (T002, T035, T055, T061, T065)
- Commit after Phase 4 (commands complete) and Phase 6 (skills complete)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate independently
- Use `grep -r` to find references before cleanup
- All 594 tests must pass before moving to next phase
