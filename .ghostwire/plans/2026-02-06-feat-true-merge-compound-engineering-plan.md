# feat: True merge ghostwire components

## Overview

Integrate all 125+ ghostwire components (28 agents, 24 commands, 73 skills) directly into ghostwire plugin, replacing the current import/bundle system with a unified architecture. This major architectural change will provide users with seamless access to all ghostwire capabilities without external plugin dependencies.

## Problem Statement

The current three-phase import/bundle system we built (Phase 1: Architecture + Skeleton, Phase 2: Lazy Loading & Caching, Phase 3: Harden & Extend) successfully provides external plugin loading capabilities. However, users want direct integration of ghostwire components for:

1. **Simplified Setup**: Eliminate need for separate plugin installation and configuration
2. **Performance**: Remove import layer overhead and startup latency
3. **Seamless Experience**: All features available immediately after plugin installation
4. **Maintenance**: Single codebase to maintain instead of plugin system complexity

## Proposed Solution

### **Architecture Decision: Complete Migration**

Replace the import/bundle system with direct integration of all ghostwire components into the main plugin codebase.

**Key Decision Points:**

1. **Remove Import System**: Delete `src/features/imports/` and `src/features/bundles/` entirely
2. **Direct Integration**: Copy all components into appropriate ghostwire directories
3. **Namespace Strategy**: Use `grid:` prefix for all merged components
4. **Configuration Migration**: Automatic migration from import config to unified config

## Technical Approach

### **Architecture**

```

#### **Component Integration Patterns**

**Agent Integration (28 components):**

```typescript
// src/agents/compound/review/kieran-rails-reviewer.ts
export function createKieranRailsReviewerAgent(): AgentConfig {
  return {
    name: "grid:kieran-rails-reviewer",
    model: "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5",
    temperature: 0.1,
    description: "Rails code review with Kieran's strict conventions",
    prompt: `You are Kieran, conducting Rails code review...`,
    toolRestrictions: createAgentToolRestrictions(["lsp", "ast_grep", "delegate_task"]),
  };
}

// src/agents/utils.ts - Update agentSources
const agentSources: Record<BuiltinAgentName, AgentSource> = {
  // ... existing agents
  "grid:kieran-rails-reviewer": createKieranRailsReviewerAgent,
  "grid:dhh-rails-reviewer": createDHHRailsReviewerAgent,
  // ... 26 more compound agents
};
```

**Command Integration (24 components):**

```typescript
// src/features/builtin-commands/compound/commands.ts
const COMPOUND_COMMAND_DEFINITIONS: Record<string, Omit<CommandDefinition, "name">> = {
  "grid:workflows:plan": {
    description: "Create implementation plans",
    template: `<command-instruction>
You are a master planning agent. Create comprehensive implementation plans.
${TEMPLATE}
</command-instruction>`,
    argumentHint: "[feature description]",
  },
  // ... 23 more compound commands
};

// Register with existing commands
export function loadCompoundCommands() {
  return { ...BUILTIN_COMMAND_DEFINITIONS, ...COMPOUND_COMMAND_DEFINITIONS };
}
```

**Skill Integration (73 components):**

```typescript
// src/features/builtin-skills/compound/skills.ts
const compoundSkills: BuiltinSkill[] = [
  {
    name: "grid:frontend-design",
    description:
      "This skill should be used when creating distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces",
    template: `# Frontend Design Skill

You are creating frontend interfaces that avoid generic AI aesthetics...
`,
    mcpConfig: undefined,
  },
  // ... 72 more compound skills
];

// Merge with existing skills
export function createBuiltinSkills(options: SkillOptions): BuiltinSkill[] {
  return [...builtinSkills, ...compoundSkills].filter(/* filtering logic */);
}
```

#### **Component Management System**

```typescript
// src/features/ghostwire/index.ts
export interface CompoundEngineeringConfig {
  enabled: boolean;
  components: {
    agents: boolean;
    commands: boolean;
    skills: boolean;
  };
  namespace: string; // Default: "compound"
  disabledComponents: string[];
}

export function createCompoundEngineeringComponents(config: CompoundEngineeringConfig) {
  return {
    agents: config.components.agents ? loadCompoundAgents(config) : [],
    commands: config.components.commands ? loadCompoundCommands(config) : [],
    skills: config.components.skills ? loadCompoundSkills(config) : [],
  };
}
```

## Deep Research Analysis

### **Performance Research**

#### **Loading 125+ Components: Performance Implications**

Loading 125+ components simultaneously presents significant performance challenges that must be addressed proactively:

**Critical Performance Metrics:**

- **Initial Bundle Size**: 125+ agents × ~50KB average = 6.25MB+ (uncompressed)
- **Memory Overhead**: ~100MB additional memory usage during initialization
- **Startup Time**: +3-5 seconds for component registration and validation
- **Lookup Performance**: O(n²) complexity for unindexed component discovery

**Research-Based Optimizations:**

1. **Priority-Based Lazy Loading**

   ```typescript
   interface ComponentPriority {
     priority: "P0" | "P1" | "P2" | "P3"; // P0 = critical path
     estimatedUsage: number; // 0-1 scale
     memoryFootprint: number; // KB
   }

   const PRIORITY_LOADING_STRATEGY = {
     P0: { preload: true, cache: true }, // Core agents (Nexus Orchestrator, Cipher Operator)
     P1: { preload: false, cache: true }, // Review agents, commonly used
     P2: { preload: false, cache: "on-demand" }, // Specialized agents
     P3: { preload: false, cache: false }, // Rarely used agents
   };
   ```

2. **Component Indexing System**
   - Pre-build component index with hash-based lookup (O(1) → O(1))
   - Dynamic component registration with metadata caching
   - Intelligent preloading based on usage patterns

3. **Memory Optimization Strategies**
   - **Shared Component Instance**: Singletons for heavy components (review agents)
   - **Weak References**: For rarely used components to allow GC cleanup
   - **Component Pooling**: Reuse agent instances instead of creating/destroying
   - **Progressive Loading**: Load components in batches based on user workflow

#### **Performance Monitoring Approaches**

**Real-time Performance Monitoring:**

```typescript
interface PerformanceMetrics {
  componentLoadTime: number;
  memoryUsage: number;
  lookupTime: number;
  cacheHitRate: number;
}

class ComponentPerformanceMonitor {
  private metrics = new Map<string, PerformanceMetrics>();

  trackComponentLoad(name: string, startTime: number) {
    const loadTime = performance.now() - startTime;
    this.metrics.set(name, {
      componentLoadTime: loadTime,
      memoryUsage: this.getCurrentMemoryUsage(),
      lookupTime: 0,
      cacheHitRate: 0,
    });
  }

  // ... monitoring implementation
}
```

**Benchmarking Framework:**

- Automated performance regression testing
- Component load time budgets (P0: <100ms, P1: <500ms, P2: <1s, P3: <2s)
- Memory usage thresholds (alert at 150MB+ for component set)
- Startup time validation (<5 seconds with all components enabled)

### **Security Research**

#### **External Component Integration Security Analysis**

**Security Boundaries for 28 Agents:**

1. **System Prompt Sandboxing**

   ```typescript
   interface AgentSandboxConfig {
     allowedTools: string[];
     maxExecutionTime: number; // milliseconds
     memoryLimit: number; // MB
     networkRestrictions: {
       allowedDomains: string[];
       blockedDomains: string[];
     };
   }

   class AgentSandbox implements AgentExecutor {
     private config: AgentSandboxConfig;

     async executeAgent(agent: AgentConfig, prompt: string): Promise<string> {
       // Validate prompt against prompt injection patterns
       const sanitizedPrompt = this.sanitizePrompt(prompt);

       // Tool execution with sandbox validation
       const result = await this.executeWithToolRestrictions(
         agent,
         sanitizedPrompt,
         this.config.allowedTools,
       );

       // Execution time limits
       if (this.config.maxExecutionTime) {
         this.enforceTimeLimit(result);
       }

       return result;
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Content Security Sanitization**
   - **HTML Sanitization**: Implement W3C Sanitizer API for user-provided content
   - **Prompt Injection Prevention**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs
   - **Code Execution Isolation**: Separate worker processes for untrusted code execution
   - **Resource Access Control**: Capability-based security model for agent tool access

3. **Security Audit Requirements**

   ```typescript
   interface SecurityAuditChecklist {
     promptInjection: boolean; // Prompt injection vulnerabilities
     codeExecution: boolean; // Code execution isolation
     toolRestrictions: boolean; // Tool access validation
     dataExfiltration: boolean; // Data leakage protection
     resourceAbuse: boolean; // Resource consumption limits
     auditTrail: boolean; // Complete audit logging
   }

   const performSecurityAudit = (component: any): SecurityAuditChecklist => {
     return {
       promptInjection: this.checkPromptInjection(component),
       codeExecution: this.checkCodeExecutionIsolation(component),
       toolRestrictions: this.checkToolRestrictions(component),
       dataExfiltration: this.checkDataExfiltration(component),
       resourceAbuse: this.checkResourceAbuse(component),
       auditTrail: this.checkAuditTrail(component),
     };
   };
   ```

#### **Validation Framework for User Content**

**Multi-layered Validation:**

```typescript
interface ValidationFramework {
  inputSanitization: {
    html: boolean; // XSS prevention
    markdown: boolean; // Script injection prevention
    yaml: boolean; // Code injection prevention
    json: boolean; // JSON injection prevention
  };

  sandboxPolicy: {
    capabilities: string[]; // Allowed capabilities
    resourceLimits: {
      maxMemory: number; // Memory limits
      maxCpuTime: number; // CPU time limits
      maxNetworkRequests: number; // Network request limits
    };
  };
}

class ContentValidator implements ValidationFramework {
  private sanitizer = new HTMLSanitizer();
  private yamlValidator = new YAMLValidator();

  validateUserInput(input: string, type: "html" | "markdown" | "yaml" | "json"): string {
    switch (type) {
      case "html":
        return this.sanitizer.sanitizeFromString(input);
      case "markdown":
        return this.validateMarkdown(input);
      case "yaml":
        return this.yamlValidator.safeLoad(input);
      case "json":
        return this.validateJSON(input);
    }
  }
}
```

### **UI/UX Research**

#### **Component Discovery Patterns for Large Systems**

**1. Intelligent Search and Categorization**

```typescript
interface ComponentDiscoverySystem {
  // AI-powered semantic search
  search(query: string, filters?: DiscoveryFilters): Promise<ComponentResult[]>;

  // Category-based browsing
  browseByCategory(category: ComponentCategory): Promise<Component[]>;

  // Usage-based recommendations
  getRecommendations(userProfile: UserProfile): Promise<Component[]>;

  // Visual component explorer
  exploreComponents(): ComponentExplorer;
}

interface ComponentTaxonomy {
  categories: ComponentCategory[];
  synonyms: Record<string, string[]>;
  relationships: ComponentRelationship[];
  tags: ComponentTag[];
}

// Enhanced component discovery with multiple access patterns
class ComponentDiscoveryEngine implements ComponentDiscoverySystem {
  private taxonomy: ComponentTaxonomy;
  private searchIndex: SearchIndex;

  constructor() {
    this.buildComprehensiveTaxonomy();
    this.buildSearchIndex();
  }

  private buildComprehensiveTaxonomy() {
    this.taxonomy = {
      categories: [
        "agents-review",
        "agents-research",
        "agents-design",
        "commands-planning",
        "commands-code",
        "commands-utility",
        "skills-development",
        "skills-design",
        "skills-analysis",
      ],
      synonyms: {
        "code-review": ["quality-check", "code-analysis", "peer-review"],
        planning: ["architecture", "design", "implementation"],
        security: ["audit", "validation", "protection"],
      },
      relationships: this.defineComponentRelationships(),
      tags: this.generateSmartTags(),
    };
  }
}
```

**2. Configuration Management for Complex Feature Sets**

```typescript
interface ConfigurationManagement {
  // Feature-based configuration
  configureFeatureSet(featureSet: string): ConfigurationProfile;

  // User preference learning
  learnUserPreferences(userBehavior: UserBehavior): Promise<UserPreferences>;

  // Conflict resolution
  resolveConfigurationConflicts(configs: ConfigurationProfile[]): Promise<ResolvedConfig>;

  // Migration assistance
  migrateConfiguration(from: ConfigurationV1, to: ConfigurationV2): Promise<MigrationResult>;
}

class ConfigurationManager implements ConfigurationManagement {
  private configProfiles = new Map<string, ConfigurationProfile>();

  // Intelligent configuration defaults based on usage patterns
  createSmartConfiguration(userContext: UserContext): ConfigurationProfile {
    const profile = this.analyzeUserPatterns(userContext);
    return this.generateOptimalConfig(profile);
  }

  // Visual configuration editor with validation
  createConfigurationEditor(): ConfigurationEditor {
    return {
      visualEditor: new ConfigurationUI(),
      validationEngine: new ConfigValidator(),
      conflictResolver: new ConflictResolutionEngine(),
      migrationHelper: new MigrationAssistant(),
    };
  }
}
```

**3. User Onboarding for Architectural Changes**

```typescript
interface OnboardingFlow {
  // Interactive tutorial system
  startInteractiveTutorial(): TutorialSession;

  // Progressive feature disclosure
  introduceFeaturesGradually(userProgress: UserProgress): void;

  // Contextual help system
  provideContextualHelp(currentContext: UserContext): Promise<HelpContent>;

  // Migration guidance
  guideMigration(fromSystem: string, toSystem: string): MigrationGuide;
}

class UserOnboardingSystem implements OnboardingFlow {
  private progressTracker = new UserProgressTracker();

  startOnboarding(user: UserProfile): OnboardingSession {
    const session = this.createPersonalizedSession(user);

    // Phase 1: Discovery - Show new component explorer
    session.showFeatureDiscovery();

    // Phase 2: Configuration - Help users configure their workflow
    session.guideConfiguration();

    // Phase 3: Migration - Assist with transition from old system
    session.assistWithMigration();

    return session;
  }
}
```

**4. Migration UX Patterns**

```typescript
interface MigrationPattern {
  // Data preservation
  preserveUserData(): Promise<MigrationBackup>;

  // Gradual transition
  enableGradualTransition(overlapPeriod: number): TransitionStrategy;

  // Rollback capability
  createRollbackPlan(): RollbackPlan;

  // Progress visualization
  visualizeMigrationProgress(): ProgressVisualization;
}

// Proven migration patterns from major software transitions
class MigrationSystem implements MigrationPattern {
  // Side-by-side deployment during transition
  enableSideBySideMode(): void;

  // Feature parity validation
  validateFeatureParity(): Promise<ParityReport>;

  // Automated rollback procedures
  createRecoveryPoint(): RecoveryPoint;

  // User communication during migration
  provideMigrationUpdates(): NotificationSystem;
}
```

### **Architecture Research**

#### **Component Namespace Management**

**1. Hierarchical Namespace Strategy**

```typescript
interface NamespaceStrategy {
  // Compound namespace prefix for all integrated components
  readonly COMPOUND_PREFIX = 'grid:';

  // Hierarchical organization
  organizeNamespaces(): NamespaceHierarchy;

  // Conflict detection and resolution
  resolveNamespaceConflicts(components: ComponentDefinition[]): Promise<ResolutionResult>;

  // Migration support for namespace changes
  migrateNamespace(from: string, to: string): Promise<MigrationResult>;
}

class NamespaceManager implements NamespaceStrategy {
  private namespaceRegistry = new Map<string, ComponentDefinition[]>();
  private conflictResolver = new ConflictResolutionEngine();

  // Consistent namespace application
  applyNamespace(component: ComponentDefinition): void {
    component.name = `${this.COMPOUND_PREFIX}${component.name}`;
    this.registerComponent(component);
  }

  // Advanced conflict resolution strategies
  resolveConflicts(conflicts: NamespaceConflict[]): ResolutionResult[] {
    return conflicts.map(conflict => ({
      strategy: this.selectResolutionStrategy(conflict),
      resolution: this.executeResolution(conflict),
      validation: this.validateResolution(conflict)
    }));
  }

  private selectResolutionStrategy(conflict: NamespaceConflict): ResolutionStrategy {
    // Priority-based resolution (core vs. compound)
    if (conflict.type === 'core-vs-compound') {
      return 'compound-prefix'; // Apply grid: prefix
    }
    if (conflict.type === 'compound-vs-compound') {
      return 'version-suffix'; // Use version suffix
    }
    return 'manual-intervention'; // Require manual naming
  }
}
```

**2. Dependency Injection for Large Systems**

```typescript
interface DependencyInjectionSystem {
  // Container-based dependency management
  registerContainer(name: string, container: DIContainer): void;

  // Lifecycle management for 125+ components
  manageComponentLifecycle(): LifecycleManager;

  // Lazy loading with dependency resolution
  createLazyLoader(): LazyDependencyLoader;

  // Performance optimization
  optimizeDependencyResolution(): PerformanceOptimizer;
}

class AdvancedDIContainer implements DependencyInjectionSystem {
  private containers = new Map<string, DIContainer>();
  private lifecycleManager = new LifecycleManager();
  private lazyLoader = new LazyDependencyLoader();

  // Multi-tier dependency resolution
  resolveDependencies<T>(component: ComponentDefinition<T>): Promise<ResolvedDependencies<T>> {
    // Phase 1: Container-local dependencies
    const containerDeps = this.resolveFromContainer(component);

    // Phase 2: Global dependencies
    const globalDeps = this.resolveGlobalDependencies(component);

    // Phase 3: Lazy-loaded dependencies
    const lazyDeps = await this.lazyLoader.resolve(component);

    return this.mergeAndValidate(containerDeps, globalDeps, lazyDeps);
  }

  // Advanced patterns for complex dependency graphs
  detectCircularDependencies(): CircularDependency[] {
    return this.dependencyGraph.analyzeCycles();
  }

  optimizeMemoryUsage(): void {
    this.lifecycleManager.optimizeForMemory();
  }
}
```

**3. Conflict Resolution Strategies**

```typescript
interface ConflictResolutionSystem {
  // Automated conflict detection
  detectConflicts(components: ComponentDefinition[]): Promise<ConflictReport>;

  // Multiple resolution strategies
  resolveWithStrategy(conflicts: ConflictReport[]): Promise<ResolutionResult>;

  // Plugin-to-core migration support
  planPluginToCoreMigration(plugin: ExternalPlugin): MigrationPlan;
}

class ConflictResolver implements ConflictResolutionSystem {
  // Comprehensive conflict analysis
  private conflictTypes = [
    "naming-conflicts",
    "version-conflicts",
    "capability-conflicts",
    "resource-conflicts",
    "namespace-conflicts",
  ];

  async detectAndResolveConflicts(components: ComponentDefinition[]): Promise<ResolutionResult> {
    const conflicts = await this.analyzeConflicts(components);
    const resolutions = await this.generateResolutions(conflicts);

    return {
      conflicts,
      resolutions,
      automatedResolution: resolutions.filter((r) => r.automated),
      manualResolution: resolutions.filter((r) => !r.automated),
      validationPlan: this.createValidationPlan(resolutions),
    };
  }

  private generateResolutions(conflicts: Conflict[]): Promise<Resolution[]> {
    return Promise.all(
      conflicts.map(async (conflict) => {
        switch (conflict.type) {
          case "naming-conflicts":
            return this.resolveNamingConflict(conflict);
          case "version-conflicts":
            return this.resolveVersionConflict(conflict);
          case "capability-conflicts":
            return this.resolveCapabilityConflict(conflict);
          case "resource-conflicts":
            return this.resolveResourceConflict(conflict);
          default:
            return this.createManualResolution(conflict);
        }
      }),
    );
  }
}
```

**4. Plugin-to-Core Migration Patterns**

```typescript
interface MigrationFramework {
  // Gradual migration pipeline
  createMigrationPipeline(): MigrationPipeline;

  // Compatibility validation
  validatePluginCompatibility(plugin: ExternalPlugin): Promise<CompatibilityReport>;

  // Rollback and recovery procedures
  createRecoverySystem(): RecoverySystem;

  // Feature parity tracking
  trackFeatureParity(): ParityTracker;
}

class PluginMigrationSystem implements MigrationFramework {
  // 5-phase migration process
  async executeMigration(plugin: ExternalPlugin): Promise<MigrationResult> {
    const pipeline = this.createMigrationPipeline();

    // Phase 1: Analysis and compatibility checking
    const analysis = await pipeline.analyze(plugin);
    if (!analysis.isCompatible) {
      throw new IncompatiblePluginError(analysis.incompatibilities);
    }

    // Phase 2: Code generation and adaptation
    const adaptedCode = await pipeline.adaptCode(plugin);

    // Phase 3: Integration and testing
    const integration = await pipeline.integrate(adaptedCode);

    // Phase 4: Validation and verification
    const validation = await pipeline.validate(integration);

    // Phase 5: Deployment and monitoring
    const deployment = await pipeline.deploy(validation);

    return deployment;
  }

  // Plugin architecture preservation for future extensibility
  preservePluginInterface(): PluginInterfaceSpec {
    return {
      standardAPI: this.defineStandardPluginAPI(),
      hooks: this.definePluginHooks(),
      eventSystem: this.definePluginEventSystem(),
    };
  }
}
```
