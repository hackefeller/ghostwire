## Initiative 1: Ultrawork Naming Unification

### Objective

Unify "ralph", "boulder", and "overclock" references under the "Ultrawork" brand with consistent naming across directories, types, functions, constants, configurations, commands, and user-facing text.

### Scope

The following categories were renamed:

- **Directory structure**: `ralph-loop/`, `boulder-state/` → `ultrawork-*`
- **Type/interface names**: `RalphLoopHook`, `BoulderState` → `UltraworkLoop*`, `UltraworkState`
- **Function names**: `createRalphLoopHook()`, `readBoulderState()` → `createUltraworkLoopHook()`, `readUltraworkState()`
- **Constants**: `RALPH_LOOP`, `BOULDER_FILE` → `ULTRAWORK_LOOP`, `ULTRAWORK_FILE`
- **System directives**: `RALPH_LOOP`, `BOULDER_CONTINUATION` → `ULTRAWORK_LOOP`, `ULTRAWORK_CONTINUATION`
- **Configuration schema**: New `UltraworkLoopConfigSchema` with `ultrawork_loop` config key
- **Commands**: `/ghostwire:overclock-loop` → `/ghostwire:ultrawork-loop`
- **File paths**: `.ghostwire/boulder.json` → `.ghostwire/ultrawork.json`
- **User-facing text**: "Ralph Loop", "Boulder state" → "Ultrawork Loop", "Ultrawork state"
- **Skill names**: `"ralph-loop"` → `"ultrawork-loop"`

## Initiative 2: Builtin Terminology Removal

### Objective

Remove outdated "builtin" prefix from directory names, file names, function names, types, and constants throughout the codebase. Replace with simpler, context-specific names.

### Scope

Target all instances of "builtin" terminology while preserving semantic meaning:

- **Directory renames**: `builtin-skills/` → `skills/`, `builtin-commands/` → `commands/`
- **File renames**: `builtin-agents-manifest.ts` → `agents-manifest.ts`
- **Function renames**: `createBuiltinSkills()` → `createSkills()`, `loadBuiltinCommands()` → `loadCommands()`
- **Type renames**: `BuiltinSkill` → `Skill`, `BuiltinCommandName` → `CommandName`
- **Constant renames**: `BUILTIN_AGENTS_MANIFEST` → `AGENTS_MANIFEST`, `builtinTools` → `tools`
- **Scope literals**: `"builtin"` → `"plugin"` (for LSP and MCP sources)
- **Description cleanup**: Remove "(builtin)" prefix from command descriptions

## Key Decisions

### Ultrawork Initiative

- **No backward compatibility aliases** (beta/unreleased status)
- **No file migration logic** (fresh installs only)
- **Wave-based approach** ensured zero import breakage
- **Git history preserved** via `git mv` for directories

### Builtin Initiative

- **Semantic preservation**: "builtin" → "plugin" for scope/type literals
- **Phase dependencies**: Strict ordering on typecheck success
- **Import path consistency**: All 14 references updated together
- **One-time operation**: No migration path needed (unreleased)

### Compound Initiative

- **Configuration hardening**: Removed dead schema references
- **Complete rename**: No legacy aliases or fallbacks
- **Consolidated cleanup**: Removed compound-specific test files
- **Archive preservation**: Historical specs remain for context

---

## Risk Mitigation & Validation

### Testing Strategy

1. **Type-level**: Full typecheck after each phase (0 errors guaranteed)
2. **Unit-level**: Individual module tests pass (1,869+ test cases)
3. **Integration-level**: Full build succeeds with all validations
4. **Smoke-level**: Plugin loads correctly with new terminology

### Rollback Plan

Each initiative was self-contained with atomic commits:

- Initiative 1: Commits at waves 1-6 boundaries
- Initiative 2: Commits at phase 2-8 boundaries
- Initiative 3: Single comprehensive commit

Rolling back any initiative requires reverting its commits only.

### Impact Assessment

- **No breaking changes** (unreleased software)
- **No migration complexity** (single-direction rename)
- **No behavioral changes** (pure refactoring)
- **Full test coverage** (1,869 tests validate consistency)
