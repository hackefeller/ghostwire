COMPLETE AGENT NAMING ANALYSIS - FINAL SUMMARY
================================================================================

REQUESTED: Complete naming analysis for ALL agents including 18 supporting/specialized

DELIVERED: Comprehensive inventory of 27 fully-implemented agents

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. COMPLETE INVENTORY:
   27 agent implementation files in src/orchestration/agents/
   
   Breakdown by category:
   - Orchestration & Execution: 4 agents
   - Code Review: 5 agents  
   - Research & Discovery: 6 agents
   - Design & Frontend: 4 agents
   - Architecture & Workflow: 3 agents
   - Advisory & Analysis: 3 agents
   - Audit: 1 agent
   - Documentation: 1 agent
   
   TOTAL: 27 agents

2. NAMING PATTERN LANDSCAPE:
   
   a) Prefix-based patterns:
      • void-* → 4 agents (execution/action focus)
      • zen-* → 2 agents (wisdom/strategy focus)
      • eye-* → 2 agents (perception/analysis focus)
      
   b) Suffix-based patterns:
      • -*scan → 5 agents (research/discovery)
      • -*check → 3 agents (verification/validation)
      • -*review → 5 agents (code quality)
      • -*loop → 1 agent (iteration)
      • -*sync → 1 agent (synchronization)
      
   c) Descriptive patterns:
      • 6 agents use explicit, multi-word names
      • No unified scheme (agent-arch, war-mind, null-audit, etc.)

3. NAMING ANALYSIS BY CATEGORY:

   a) ORCHESTRATION & EXECUTION (4):
      - zen-planner: Strategic planning, interview mode
      - grid-sync: Master orchestrator, delegate_task conductor
      - void-runner: General executor, SF Bay engineer style
      - dark-runner: Focused executor, no delegation
      
      Pattern: Mix of zen- prefix and descriptive names
      Distinction unclear: Why both "void" and "dark" runner?
      Strength: Intent clear from name

   b) CODE REVIEW (5):
      - void-review-rails: Kieran Rails reviewer
      - void-review-ts: Kieran TypeScript reviewer
      - void-review-python: Kieran Python reviewer
      - zen-review-rails: DHH Rails (architectural)
      - mono-review: Code simplicity (YAGNI)
      
      Pattern: Inconsistent (void-review-X vs zen-review-rails vs mono-review)
      Issue: "mono-review" doesn't match void/zen pattern
      Strength: Language clearly indicated in name

   c) RESEARCH & DISCOVERY (6):
      - data-dive: Library/framework research (Archive Researcher)
      - scan-ops: Codebase exploration (Scout Recon)
      - best-practices-scan: External best practices
      - docs-scan: Framework documentation
      - learnings-scan: Institutional solutions
      - git-scan: Code archaeology
      
      Pattern: Mostly -*scan suffix (5 of 6), one descriptive
      Strength: Research intent evident from naming
      Issue: data-dive doesn't follow -*scan pattern

   d) DESIGN & FRONTEND (4):
      - figma-sync: Design tool synchronization
      - design-check: Design QA/implementation review
      - design-loop: Iterative design refinement
      - ui-build: Frontend UI production
      
      Pattern: design-* prefix and descriptive names
      Strength: Design purpose clear
      Issue: ui-build doesn't match design-* pattern

   e) ARCHITECTURE & WORKFLOW (3):
      - agent-arch: Agent-native architecture
      - flow-check: UX flow specification analysis
      - deploy-check: Deployment safety verification
      
      Pattern: All descriptive, no unified scheme
      Strength: Purpose explicit
      Consistency: Low - each has unique name

   f) ADVISORY & ANALYSIS (3):
      - eye-ops: Seer advisor (architecture guidance)
      - eye-scan: Multimodal media analyzer
      - war-mind: Tactician strategist (pre-planning)
      
      Pattern: eye-* prefix, descriptive, war-mind
      Strength: Metaphorical, memorable names
      Issue: war-mind doesn't follow eye-* pattern

   g) AUDIT (1):
      - null-audit: Glitch auditor (plan validation)
      
      Pattern: Descriptive (Greek mythology reference)
      Strength: Memorable, unique
      Issue: Stands alone, no pattern to extrapolate

   h) DOCUMENTATION (1):
      - docs-write-readme: Ankane-style README writer
      
      Pattern: Descriptive, compound name
      Strength: Purpose crystal clear
      Consistency: Unique within category

4. NAMING CONSISTENCY ISSUES:

   Issue 1: Pattern Inconsistency
   - Some agents use prefix pattern (void-*, zen-*, eye-*)
   - Some use suffix pattern (-scan, -check, -review)
   - Some use purely descriptive naming
   - No consistent logic across all 27

   Issue 2: Category Not Evident
   - Cannot determine agent's category from name alone
   - "void-runner" vs "dark-runner" – why different?
   - "data-dive" vs "*-scan" pattern – why different?
   - "ui-build" vs "design-*" pattern – why different?

   Issue 3: Multiple Name Layers
   - Filename: zen-planner.ts
   - Export: createZenPlannerAgent
   - PromptAlias: "zen-planner"
   - Internal ID: augurPlanner
   - Metaphorical origin: Titan Prometheus
   
   Context-switching required to understand full identity

   Issue 4: Metadata Aliases Inconsistent
   - "Kieran Rails Reviewer" vs "Best Practices Researcher"
   - "Code Simplicity Reviewer" vs "Figma Design Sync"
   - No capitalization/format standard

   Issue 5: Unclear Distinctions
   - void-runner vs dark-runner (both executors)
   - void-review-* vs zen-review-rails (both reviewers)
   - best-practices-scan vs docs-scan (both research)
   - design-check vs design-loop (related but named differently)

5. NAMING STRENGTHS TO PRESERVE:

   ✓ Kebab-case convention: Consistent across all 27 agents
   ✓ Factory pattern: createXxxAgent is clear and searchable
   ✓ Semantic meaningfulness: Names relate to purpose
   ✓ Metaphorical depth: Mythological/thematic references (zen, void, eye, etc.)
   ✓ Descriptiveness: Most names are self-explanatory
   ✓ Discoverability: Kebab-case enables easy grep/search
   ✓ File organization: Clear directory structure

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

For Next Phase (Naming Proposal):

1. DEFINE NAMING PRINCIPLES:
   - What matters most: category clarity vs. memorable names?
   - Should prefix/suffix scheme apply uniformly?
   - How many naming patterns can coexist?
   - Should names reveal function vs. be thematic?

2. ESTABLISH CONSTRAINTS:
   - Maintain kebab-case
   - Keep createXxxAgent factory pattern
   - Preserve metaphorical elements (if desired)
   - Consider migration impact (27 files to update)

3. CREATE SEMANTIC SCHEME:
   See COMPLETE_AGENT_INVENTORY.md for three proposed strategies:
   
   Option 1: Category-First Prefixes
   Option 2: Thematic Consistency  
   Option 3: Hybrid Approach
   
   Each has tradeoffs for clarity, discoverability, metaphor

4. MIGRATION PLANNING:
   Per file rename requires updates to:
   - Filenames (27 files)
   - Export functions (27 exports)
   - System prompts (27 constants)
   - Metadata exports (27 metadata objects)
   - Compound mappings (compound/index.ts)
   - Documentation (multiple files)
   - Tests (multiple test files)
   - User-facing descriptions

SCOPE CLARIFICATION
================================================================================

User asked for: "18 supporting/specialized agents"
Actual inventory: 27 fully-implemented agents in src/orchestration/agents/

The distinction:
- 4 primary orchestrators/executors (zen-planner, grid-sync, void-runner, dark-runner)
- 23 specialized agents across 7 domains
- No "primary vs supporting" distinction in current codebase
- All 27 are equally important/specialized for their domains

The "28" mentioned likely referred to compound/index.ts which shows:
- 20 fully implemented agents
- 2 placeholder stubs (every-style-editor, andrew-kane-gem-writer)
- ~9 additional documentation agents (not yet implemented)

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

To proceed with agent renaming:

1. Review the three naming strategy options in COMPLETE_AGENT_INVENTORY.md
2. Define which strategy aligns with team philosophy
3. Create proposed new names for all 27 agents
4. Plan migration in phases to avoid breaking changes
5. Update all 7 layers of naming (filenames, exports, prompts, metadata, docs, etc.)
