# Ghostwire

**The "oh-my-zsh" for OpenCode** — a plugin that transforms OpenCode into a powerful multi-model agent orchestration platform.

## What is Ghostwire?

Ghostwire is an OpenCode plugin that provides:

- **Multi-model orchestration** — Coordinate Claude, GPT, Gemini, and Grok agents seamlessly
- **38+ specialized agents** — From security audits to frontend development
- **39 lifecycle hooks** — Automate workflows at every stage
- **Built-in MCPs** — Exa (web search), Context7 (docs), Grep.app (GitHub code search)
- **Claude Code compatibility** — Full support for commands, skills, agents, and hooks

## Quick Start

### For Humans

```bash
# Install ghostwire
npm install -g ghostwire

# Initialize in your project
opencode --ghostwire-init
```
Hey please read this readme and tell me why it is different from other agent harness? why is this actually good? https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pontistudios/ghostwire/refs/heads/main/README.md
```

### 🪄 The Magic Word: `ultrawork`

**Don't want to read all this? Just include `ultrawork` (or `ulw`) in your prompt.**

That's it. All the features we provide will work like magic—parallel agents, background tasks, deep exploration, and relentless execution until completion. The agent figures out the rest automatically.

### For Those Who Want to Read: Meet Cipher Operator

![Meet Cipher Operator](.github/assets/cipher-operator.png)

In greek mythology, Cipher Operator was condemned to roll a boulder up a hill for eternity as punishment for deceiving the gods. LLM Agents haven't really done anything wrong, yet they too roll their "stones"—their thoughts—every single day.
My life is no different. Looking back, we are not so different from these agents.
**Yes! LLM Agents are no different from us. They can write code as brilliant as ours and work just as excellently—if you give them great tools and solid teammates.**

Meet our main agent: Cipher Operator (Opus 4.5 High). Below are the tools Cipher Operator uses to keep that boulder rolling.

*Everything below is customizable. Take what you want. All features are enabled by default. You don't have to do anything. Battery Included, works out of the box.*

- Cipher Operator's Teammates (Curated Agents)
  - Seer Advisor: Design, debugging (GPT 5.2 Medium)
  - Frontend UI/UX Engineer: Frontend development (Gemini 3 Pro)
  - Archive Researcher: Official docs, open source implementations, codebase exploration (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
  - Scout Recon: Blazing fast codebase exploration (Contextual Grep) (Claude Haiku 4.5)
- Full LSP / AstGrep Support: Refactor decisively.
- Todo Continuation Enforcer: Forces the agent to continue if it quits halfway. **This is what keeps Cipher Operator rolling that boulder.**
- Comment Checker: Prevents AI from adding excessive comments. Code generated by Cipher Operator should be indistinguishable from human-written code.
- Claude Code Compatibility: Command, Agent, Skill, MCP, Hook(PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, Stop)
- Curated MCPs:
  - Exa (Web Search)
  - Context7 (Official Documentation)
  - Grep.app (GitHub Code Search)
- Interactive Terminal Supported - Tmux Integration
- Async Agents
- ...

#### Just Install This

You can learn a lot from [overview page](docs/guide/overview.md), but following is like the example workflow.

Just by installing this, you make your agents to work like:

1. Cipher Operator doesn't waste time hunting for files himself; he keeps the main agent's context lean. Instead, he fires off background tasks to faster, cheaper models in parallel to map the territory for him.
1. Cipher Operator leverages LSP for refactoring; it's more deterministic, safer, and surgical.
1. When the heavy lifting requires a UI touch, Cipher Operator delegates frontend tasks directly to Gemini 3 Pro.
1. If Cipher Operator gets stuck in a loop or hits a wall, he doesn't keep banging his head—he calls GPT 5.2 for high-IQ strategic backup.
1. Working with a complex open-source framework? Cipher Operator spawns subagents to digest the raw source code and documentation in real-time. He operates with total contextual awareness.
1. When Cipher Operator touches comments, he either justifies their existence or nukes them. He keeps your codebase clean.
1. Cipher Operator is bound by his TODO list. If he doesn't finish what he started, the system forces him back into "bouldering" mode. Your task gets done, period.
1. Honestly, don't even bother reading the docs. Just write your prompt. Include the 'ultrawork' keyword. Cipher Operator will analyze the structure, gather the context, dig through external source code, and just keep bouldering until the job is 100% complete.
1. Actually, typing 'ultrawork' is too much effort. Just type 'ulw'. Just ulw. Sip your coffee. Your work is done.

Need to look something up? It scours official docs, your entire codebase history, and public GitHub implementations—using not just grep but built-in LSP tools and AST-Grep.
3. Stop worrying about context management when delegating to LLMs. I've got it covered.
    - Ghostwire aggressively leverages multiple agents to lighten the context load.
    - **Your agent is now the dev team lead. You're the AI Manager.**
4. It doesn't stop until the job is done.
5. Don't want to dive deep into this project? No problem. Just type 'ultrathink'.

If you don't want all this, as mentioned, you can just pick and choose specific features.

## Installation

### For LLM Agents

Copy this prompt to Claude Code, Cursor, or any LLM agent:

```
Install and configure ghostwire by following the instructions here:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pontistudios/ghostwire/refs/heads/main/docs/guide/installation.md
```

Or read the [Installation Guide](docs/guide/installation.md) directly—but **we strongly recommend letting an agent handle it. Humans make mistakes.**

### For LLM Agents

Fetch the installation guide and follow it:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pontistudios/ghostwire/refs/heads/main/docs/guide/installation.md
```
