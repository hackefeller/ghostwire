# Archive: Agent Documentation

These files have been archived because their content has been consolidated into a single authoritative document.

## Migration Location

All agent renaming documentation is now consolidated in: **`docs/AGENT_RENAMING.md`**

## What Was Here

- `AGENT_NAMING_REFERENCE.md` - Quick lookup reference for all 27 agents (old names)
- `COMPLETE_AGENT_INVENTORY.md` - Comprehensive inventory with naming analysis

## Why These Were Archived

These reference documents contained:
- Agent information before renaming
- Naming pattern analysis
- Migration notes for the old naming schemes

All this information has been consolidated into the new `docs/AGENT_RENAMING.md` which provides:
- Before/after mapping for all renames
- Updated agent references with new names
- Current naming convention explanation
- Implementation details
- Bug fixes and verification

## Accessing Archived Files

If you need to reference the original analysis (unlikely), they are stored in this `.archive/` directory.
