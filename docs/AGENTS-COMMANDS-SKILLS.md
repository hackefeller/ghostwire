# Ghostwire Agent, Command, and Skill Map

This document now defers to the canonical metadata sources so there is a single source of truth for agents, commands, and skills within the Ghostwire project:

- Agents: see `docs/agents.yml`
- Commands: see `docs/commands.yml`
- Skills: see `docs/skills.yml`

Each linked YAML file describes the complete inventory, covering counts, categories, and descriptions that replace the tables previously embedded here.
