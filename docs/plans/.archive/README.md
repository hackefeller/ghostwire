# Archive: Agent Renaming Plans

These files have been archived because their content has been consolidated into a single authoritative document.

## Migration Location

All agent renaming documentation is now consolidated in: **`docs/AGENT_RENAMING.md`**

## What Was Here

- `2026-02-19-refactor-agent-renaming.md` - Original refactor plan with 8 phases
- `2026-02-20-agent-renaming-phase1-plan.md` - Phase 1 execution plan
- `2026-02-21-agent-renaming-phase2-plan.md` - Phase 2 execution plan
- `2026-02-22-agent-renaming-phase3-plan.md` - Phase 3 execution plan
- `2026-02-23-agent-renaming-phase4-plan.md` - Phase 4 execution plan
- `2026-02-24-agent-renaming-phase5-plan.md` - Phase 5 execution plan

## Why These Were Archived

The phase-specific plans were execution artifacts from the renaming project. They have been consolidated into a single, comprehensive document to:

1. **Eliminate duplication** - Each phase plan duplicated common information
2. **Improve clarity** - Single source of truth for agent renaming information
3. **Reduce confusion** - Users were unclear which document to reference
4. **Enable maintenance** - Easier to keep one document up-to-date than nine

## What's in the Consolidated Document

See `docs/AGENT_RENAMING.md` for:
- Complete mapping of all 27 agent renames
- Phase breakdown and execution order
- Implementation details and what changed
- Bug fix explanation (isPlanAgent)
- Git history and verification checklist
- Legacy alias mappings
- Migration patterns for future renames

## Accessing Archived Files

If you need to reference the original plans (unlikely), they are stored in this `.archive/` directory.
