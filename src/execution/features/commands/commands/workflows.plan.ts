# Workflows:Plan Command (Canonical)

Transform a feature request, bug report, or refactor idea into one strictly formatted plan document. This command always follows the same execution pipeline and output schema.

## Input

<feature-description>
$ARGUMENTS
</feature-description>

If the feature description is empty, ask:
"What should I plan? Provide the feature, bug, or refactor scope."
Do not continue until scope is explicit.

## Required Execution Pipeline

1. Brainstorm first
- Check for brainstorm artifacts in docs/brainstorms/.
- If one or more relevant brainstorms exist, use the most recent relevant file as prior context.
- If none exists, run a short collaborative brainstorm with AskUserQuestion to converge on problem framing, constraints, and success criteria.
- Summarize brainstorm output as explicit decisions and open questions.

2. Run mandatory local research
- Run in parallel:
  - Task researcher-repo(feature_description)
  - Task researcher-learnings(feature_description)
- Extract file-level evidence with line references where possible.
- Capture conventions from CLAUDE.md and any relevant project governance docs.

3. Run mandatory external research
- Run in parallel:
  - Task researcher-practices(feature_description)
  - Task researcher-docs(feature_description)
- Focus on current authoritative sources and implementation caveats.
- Record at least 2 external references when applicable.

4. Consolidate research
- Produce one synthesis block containing:
  - Local patterns to reuse
  - Institutional learnings and gotchas
  - External guidance
  - Explicit tradeoffs and unresolved risks

5. Setup issue tracking metadata
- Detect project tracker preference from CLAUDE.md:
  - project_tracker: github
  - project_tracker: linear
- If not configured, ask the user to choose GitHub, Linear, or Other.
- Populate issue_tracker in frontmatter.
- Populate issue_url with:
  - Existing issue URL if known
  - pending if issue not created yet

6. Write plan file
- Write to: .ghostwire/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-name-plan.md
- type must be one of: feat, fix, refactor
- Use kebab-case for filename; no spaces or colons.
- Filename must start with the exact date prefix from frontmatter date.
- Never write plan files outside .ghostwire/plans/.

## Output Contract

Use exactly this output format. Do not switch templates based on complexity. Do not emit MINIMAL, MORE, or A LOT variants.

## Required Plan Validation (Before Finalizing)

Before finalizing, verify all conditions:
- Frontmatter exists and is the very first block in the file.
- Frontmatter includes exactly these required keys at minimum: title, type, date, status.
- date format is strictly YYYY-MM-DD.
- status is one of: draft, ready, completed, example.
- The first H1 after frontmatter matches frontmatter title semantics.
- The document includes all required sections from the output contract.
- Implementation Steps uses checkbox tasks (\`- [ ]\`) and no numbered list.
- Metadata fields belong in frontmatter; do not duplicate status/date/author/priority block lines in the body preamble.
- File path matches \`.ghostwire/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md\`.

## Post-Generation Tracking Step

After writing the plan:
1. Ask user if issue should be created now.
2. If yes and tracker is GitHub:
   - gh issue create --title "<type>: <title>" --body-file <plan_path>
3. If yes and tracker is Linear:
   - linear issue create --title "<type>: <title>" --description "$(cat <plan_path>)"
4. Update issue_url in frontmatter with the created URL.
5. Ask whether to proceed with /workflows:create next.

NEVER implement code in this command. Produce planning output only.
