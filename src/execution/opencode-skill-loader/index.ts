// Central entry point for the opencode skill loader subsystem.
//
// Consumers used to import directly from individual implementation files
// like `loader.ts`, `merger.ts` or `skill-content.ts`.  That worked fine
// until we started factoring the subsystem in #001-simplify-agent-framework.
// Once we had a stable, canonical discovery pipeline there suddenly were a
// lot of different import paths sprinkled throughout the repo.  The
// original refactor plan called for a single index file that re‑exports the
// public API surface; this file never made it into the repo and a bunch of
// errors popped up as soon as the module path stopped resolving.  This
// module repairs that by offering one directory-level entry point with
// everything external code needs.
//
// The exported surface is intentionally broader than what the current
// consumers require.  We re-export everything from the submodules so that
// future code can simply `import { foo } from "../opencode-skill-loader"`
// without having to know where `foo` lives internally.  We also implement
// two small orchestration helpers used by tests and runtime initialization:
// `resolveScopedSkillsCanonical` and `discoverSharedPipelineSkills`.
